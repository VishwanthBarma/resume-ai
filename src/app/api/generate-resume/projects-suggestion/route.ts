        Consider techstack from project content and use in the output.
        
        Give me the well defined output as two points from the description so that i can put it in my resume,
        Just give me 2 points of bullet point, where each point should no exceed 80 words, dont give any other explanation.
        Output should be a string without any special characters like * only just with two bullet point points at the beginning, like each point should start with 'â€¢'.
